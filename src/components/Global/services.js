                  Hello! My name is Raya Anderson and I am a software engineer
                  with a strong passion for learning, creativity, and the desire
                  to achieve greater personal programming acumen. I graduated
                  from a coding boot camp and am attaining ever-increasing
                  technical capability acquired through studying, collaborative
                  efforts with colleagues, peers, and friends at game jams, and
                  hackathons. I enjoy learning and my curiosity led me to attend
                  a coding bootcamp, coding meet-ups, and I won a Hackathon. I
                  learned new skills like Three.js, Vue, and Gatsby! Along with
                  learning cool, new stuff, I've sharpened existing skills.
                  Given my skill-set and passion for software engineering I
                  believe I will be a benefit to a team that values quality,
                  innovation, and creativity.
